# AlgeEngine

**AlgeEngine** is a personal project created purely for **practicing graphics programming and game development techniques**.

This engine is not meant for production or general use — it's simply a hands-on way for me to explore and learn more about rendering, ECS design, input handling, and other key components of a modern game engine.

## 📚 Learning Source

Much of the work and structure in this repository follows along with [**GetIntoGameDev's excellent YouTube series on making a game engine**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3eTxaOtL2PHxN8EHf-ktAcN-sGETKfw).

All credit goes to them for the tutorial content and project inspiration.
